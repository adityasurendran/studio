# Project Dossier: Interactive AI-Powered Educational Platform

## Project Name
Interactive AI-Powered Educational Platform

## Brief Description
Develop a web application that provides personalized and engaging educational content for young learners. The platform will leverage AI to generate custom lessons, recommend learning paths, and create supporting visual content. It will include robust user authentication, child profile management, and a parent dashboard for tracking progress and settings.

## Key Features

### Core Educational Content Generation
- **AI-powered lesson generation:** Generate personalized lessons on various topics, adapting complexity based on the child's age and selected difficulty level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). The AI should generate engaging narratives, clear explanations, and age-appropriate vocabulary. Examples of prompts: "Generate a beginner lesson about dinosaurs for a 5-year-old," "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms for an 8-year-old," "Create a short story about friendship for a 6-year-old." Expected output: Textual lesson content tailored to the prompt, including explanations, examples, and potentially simple questions.
- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create relevant and visually appealing illustrations to accompany the lesson text. Images should be generated based on descriptive prompts derived from the lesson content. Resolution should be suitable for web display (e.g., 1024x1024 pixels), and an aspect ratio of 1:1 is preferred for consistency. Images must **not** contain any embedded text. The image generation should aim for diversity and inclusivity in representations. Examples of prompts for image generation (derived from lesson text): "Illustration of a happy child reading a book," "Picture of a dinosaur eating leaves," "Image of a plant with sun rays." Expected output: High-quality image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) that visually represent the textual description without any text within the image itself.
- **Adaptive learning paths:** Dynamically recommend the next lessons or topics based on the child's interaction with the platform, performance on quizzes (if implemented), and stated interests.
- Adaptive learning paths and recommendations based on child performance and interests.
- **Content adaptation:** The AI should adjust the language, sentence structure, and overall complexity of the generated content based on the selected difficulty level and the child's presumed reading level.
- **Quiz/Question Generation (Optional):** Ability for the AI to generate simple comprehension questions related to the lesson content to reinforce learning.

### User Management and Profiles
- Secure user authentication (signup, signin) for parents/guardians.
- Ability for parents to create and manage multiple child profiles.
- Individual progress tracking and settings for each child profile.

### Dashboard and Analytics
- Parent dashboard providing insights into child progress, completed lessons, and areas for improvement.
- **Progress Tracking:** Detailed view of lessons completed by each child, time spent on the platform, and performance on any interactive elements.
- **Customization:** Parents can set learning goals, specify topics of interest, and adjust the difficulty level for lesson generation for each child.
- **Insights and Summaries:** (If using a summarization model) Provide concise summaries of a child's learning patterns and strengths/weaknesses.
- **Child Dashboard (Simplified):** A child-friendly interface to access assigned/recommended lessons, view their completed lessons, and potentially customize their profile appearance (e.g., avatar).

### Content Discovery and Management
- Browsable library of generated and curated lessons.
- Functionality for saving and revisiting favorite lessons.
- **Search and Filtering:** Allow users to search for lessons by topic, keyword, or difficulty level.
- **Categorization:** Organize lessons by subject area or theme.

### Interactive Elements
- Engaging lesson presentation with text, images, and potentially simple interactive questions or activities.

## Target Audience
Parents and guardians of young children (approximately ages 3-10) seeking supplemental, personalized, and engaging educational resources.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (with React and TypeScript) for a performant and scalable web application.
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore for database, Storage for images) for user management, data storage, and file storage.
- **AI Integration:** Utilizing external AI model APIs for text generation and image generation.

## AI Model Requirements
- **Text Generation Model:** Required for generating lesson content, explanations, and potentially interactive questions. The model should be capable of generating age-appropriate, coherent, and grammatically correct text.
- **Image Generation Model (without text):** Required for creating visual aids (illustrations) for the lesson content. The model should be able to generate images based on textual descriptions, focusing on generating the visual content itself without embedding text within the image. This is crucial for creating pure illustrations.
- **Recommendation Model (Optional but desirable):** An AI model capable of analyzing user interaction data and suggesting relevant lessons or topics.
- **Summarization Model (Optional but desirable):** An AI model capable of summarizing child performance or insights for the parent dashboard.
